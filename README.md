# Student-Library-system
<p>We have developed a website to create an innovative Library Information Management System. The main idea is currently our library uses barcode scanner that records the book check-in and check-out processes, all managed efficiently by librarians through emails. This system ensures that librarians can maintain an accurate and up-to-date database with ease.
To address the challenges faced by students, we have developed a comprehensive Student Library Informative website. Previously, students were unable to access the library website from external IP locations, struggled to locate specific books within different sections (A, B, C, D), and lacked information on the availability of reference, research, and lending books in the library.
Our newly developed website overcomes these obstacles by providing students with an intuitive and informative platform. This enhances their library experience and ensures they have the resources they need at their fingertips. This project showcases our proficiency in web development and our commitment to improving library management and student access to information.</p>
